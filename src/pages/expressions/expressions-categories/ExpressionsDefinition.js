            <p>Idiomatic expressions are a type of informal language that have a meaning
               different from the meaning of the words in the expression. So for example
               in the expression <strong>time is money</strong> we are not literally saying that time
               is actual currency. We are explaining that time is a valuable resource. 
               Some expressions don't have meaning even in a literal sense, e.g., &nbsp;
               <strong>mind your own business</strong>. It means to have respect for other people's privacy.
