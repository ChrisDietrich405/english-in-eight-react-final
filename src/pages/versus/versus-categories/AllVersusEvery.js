      <p className="grammar-explanation-paragraph">
        We use both all and every to describe a total number of something. Every
        describes each member of a complete group. All describes a complete
        group.
      </p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>The food was sent to all students</li>
        <li>The food was sent to every student</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some situations we use <b>all </b>on its own. We can also use
        everyone/everybody/everything.
      </p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>
          The bingo event is at Camden Yards. It starts at 4 and all are
          welcome.
        </li>

          The bingo event is at Camden Yards. It starts at 4 and everyone is
          welcome.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We can use every to focus on each individual member.</p>
      <p>Compare:</p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>
          All attendees need to silence their phones. (describes the entire
          group)
        </li>
        <li>
          Every attendee needs to silence their phones. (describes the
          individuals )
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We use <b>every </b> with singular entitites and <b>all</b> with uncountable and plural nouns 
      </p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>Every payment is due today.</li>
        <li>All payments are due today.</li>
      </ul>
      {/* <p>
        We use all day, all week, all month to mean ‘one entire day/week/month’:
      </p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>We spent all day at the beach yesterday.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Every day (week/month) focuses on each individual day (week/month):</p>
      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>We spent every day at the beach when we were on vacation .</li>
