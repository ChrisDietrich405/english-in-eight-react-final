Remember + infinitive means that we don’t forget to do something:

Remember + the -ing form of a verb means ‘have a memory of something we did or of something that happened in the past:

She said she didn’t remember getting an email from him.


Remind

If a person or thing reminds you of someone or something, they make you think of that person or thing, or they resemble that person or thing:

That song always reminds me of the time I fell in love with a Nigerian girl.

Jason reminds me of my father. They have the same eyes and the same way of talking.


If we remind someone to do something or about something, we make them remember it or help them not to forget it:

Remind me to email Tony today; otherwise I’ll probably forget.
