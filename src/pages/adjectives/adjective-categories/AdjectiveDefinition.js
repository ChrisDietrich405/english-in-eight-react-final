        <p> An adjective is a word that tells us more about a noun. It "describes" or "modifies" a noun (The <bold>big</bold> <i>dog</i> was hungry). In these examples, the adjective is in bold and the noun that it modifies is in italics. An adjective often comes BEFORE a noun: a green car.

                He has a beautiful car
                beautiful is an adjective describing car (it gives more information about the noun car.)
                2. Adjectives may come before a noun
                He has a good job
                3. Adjectives may also come after certain verbs like be, feel, seem, look:
                He is intelligent
                I feel happy
                She seems unhappy
