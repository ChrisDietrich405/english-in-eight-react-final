        <p className="grammar-explanation-paragraph">
          Superlative adjectives are used to compare three or more nouns,
          indicating the highest or most extreme degree of a particular quality.
          They are used when you want to highlight the greatest level of a
          certain characteristic within a group of items or individuals.
          Superlative adjectives typically end in "-est" for one-syllable
          adjectives or use "most" before the adjective for longer adjectives.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className="page-body">
        <h5>Adjectives with one syllable</h5>
        <p>
          If an adjective has one syllable, we usually add 'est' to make the
          superlative form.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>smart → smartest</li>
          <li>fast → fastest</li>
          <li>tall → tallest</li>
          <li>old → oldest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are some spelling changes. If the adjective ends in 'e', we
          don't add another 'e', just 'r'.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>brave → bravest</li>
          <li>safe → safest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If there is one vowel followed by one consonant at the end of the
          adjective, we often double the consonant.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>sad → sadder</li>
          <li>hot → hotter</li>
          <li>big → bigger</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the adjective ends in 'e', we don't add another 'e', just 'r'.</p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>brave → bravest</li>
          <li>safe → safest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are some adjectives that we need to use 'more' with, even though
          they only have one syllable. Adding -er is incorrect for these verbs.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>real → more real (NOT realer)</li>
          <li>fun → more fun (NOT funner)</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Adjectives with two syllables</h5>
        <p>Some adjectives with two syllables use 'more'.</p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>thoughtful → more thoughtful</li>
          <li>peaceful → more peaceful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, some two syllable adjectives can use 'est'.</p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>quiet → quietest</li>
          <li>cruel → cruelest</li>
          <li>simple → simplest</li>
          <li>quiet → quietest</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For adjectives with two syllables that end in 'y' we normally add 'er'
          (y generally changes to i).
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>funny → funniest</li>
          <li>happy → happiest</li>
          <li>ugly → ugliest</li>
          <li>silly → silliest</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Adjectives with more than two syllables</h5>
        <p>
          Adjectives that have more than two syllables need to use 'most' to
          form their superlative.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>delicious → most delicious</li>
          <li>interesting → most interesting</li>
          <li>exotic → most exotic</li>
          <li>intelligent → most intelligent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Irregular adjectives</p>
        <p>
          There are also some irregular adjectives. We simply need to memorize
          them.
        </p>
        <ul className="page-examples">
          <li>good → best</li>
          <li>bad → worst</li>
          <li>far → furthest</li>
          <li>little → least</li>
          <li>much → most</li>
        </ul>
