                <p>To make the superlative form (like 'biggest' or 'most expensive'), first we need to know how many syllables are in the adjective.</p>

            <p>Adjectives with one syllable</p>
            <p>Usually if an adjective has only one syllable, we add 'est' to make the superlative form.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>clean → cleanest</li>
                <li>small → smallest</li>
                <li>young → youngest</li>
                <li>tall → tallest</li>
                
            </ul>
            <p>There are some spelling changes. If there is one vowel followed by one consonant at the end of the adjective, we often double the consonant.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>wet → wettest</li>
                <li>big → biggest</li>
                <li>hot → hottest</li>
                <li>thin → thinnest</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the adjective ends in 'y', this often changes to 'i'.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>dry → driest</li>
                <li>busy → busiest</li>   
            </ul>
            <p>If the adjective ends in 'e', we don't add another 'e', just 'r'.</p>



nice → nicest
large → largest
Even when the adjective has only one syllable, it's still not wrong to use 'most'. It's possible to say  'most tall'. This isn't incorrect.

There are a few adjectives that we have to use 'more' or 'most' with, even though they only have one syllable. We CAN'T add 'er' or 'est'.
fun → most fun (NOT  funnest)
real → most real (NOT realest)
right → most right (NOT rightest)
wrong → most wrong (NOT wrongest)
Adjectives with two syllables

For adjectives with two syllables we generally use 'more' or 'most'.
careful → most careful
bored → most bored
But some two syllable adjectives can take  'est'. It's also fine to use 'most' (for the superlative).
clever → cleverest
simple → simplest
narrow → narrowest
quiet → quietest
Adjectives with two syllables that end in 'y' usually can add 'er' or 'est' (y generally changes to i). It's also fine to use 'more' or 'most'.
dirty → dirtiest
pretty → prettiest
happy → happiest
ugly → ugliest
Adjectives with more than two syllables

Adjectives with more than two syllables can only make their superlative by using 'most'.
beautiful → most beautiful
intelligent → most intelligent
interesting → more most interesting
expensive → most expensive
Irregular adjectives

There are also some irregular adjectives. We just need to learn these forms.
good →  best
bad → worst
far →  furthest
little → least
much → most
