            <p>The present tense verbs are the most widely used verbs in the English language.
               Think about all the times you talk to friends and family about what's happening 
               today. Have you ever thought about how much you do this? Personally, I've been
               thinking a lot about this recently. By the way I included all four tenses in 
               this paragraph. Challenge yourself and try to identify them.
