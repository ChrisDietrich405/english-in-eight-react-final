        The simple present tense in English is used to describe actions, events,
        or states that are habitual, repeated, or generally true. It is one of
        the basic tenses and is used when the action is happening in the present
        time or when something is a permanent fact. The positive form for
        regular verbs is really easy. It's just the verb with an extra 's' if
        the subject is 'he', 'she', or 'it'.
