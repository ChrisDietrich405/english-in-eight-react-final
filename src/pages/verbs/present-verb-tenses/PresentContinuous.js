          The present progressive tense is a verb form used to describe an
          ongoing action or event that is happening at the current moment. It is
          formed by using the auxiliary verb "to be" in the present tense,
          followed by the main verb with "-ing" added to the end. For example,
          in the sentence "She is reading a book," the present progressive tense
          is "is reading," indicating that the action of reading is happening
          right now.
