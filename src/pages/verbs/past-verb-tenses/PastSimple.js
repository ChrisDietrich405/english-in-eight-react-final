        The simple past, also known as the past simple, is a verb tense used to
        describe actions, events, or states that occurred and were completed in
        the past. It is one of the basic verb tenses in English and is generally
        used to express actions that happened at a specific time in the past, or
        to narrate a sequence of events in the past.

          For irregular verbs, things are more challenging. For example the
          simple past tense of some irregular verbs look exactly like the root
          form:
        </p>
        <div className="table-container">
          <table className="table-body">

          For other irregular verbs, the simple past forms are much different
          than their infinitive forms:
