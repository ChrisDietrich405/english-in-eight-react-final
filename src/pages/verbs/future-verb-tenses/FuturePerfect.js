        We use the future perfect to talk about 'how long' an action will have
        lasted compared to another action.{" "}

      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>Nia will have married Demarcus by then.</li>
        <li>The storm will have finished by the time we arrive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We use the future perfect with a future time word, (and often with 'by')
        to talk about an action that will finish before a certain time in the
        future, but we don't know exactly when.

        <li>By 10, I will have finished my homework.</li>
        <li>By the time I'm sixty, I will have retired.</li>
