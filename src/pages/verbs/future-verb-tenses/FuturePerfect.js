        The future perfect is used with a future time word, (and often with 'by')
        to talk about an action that will finish before a specific time in the
        future, but we're not sure exactly when.

      <ul className="page-examples">
        <li>By the time I'm seventy, I will have retired.</li>
        <li>By 10, he will have finished the housework.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The future perfect is used to indicate 'how long' an action will have
        lasted compared to another action.{" "}
