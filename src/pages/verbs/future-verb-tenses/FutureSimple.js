        The simple future is a verb tense that's used to talk about things that
        haven't happened yet. For example, next year she <b>will change</b>{" "}
        careers. The simple future is used to talk about an action or condition
        that will begin and end in the future. There are two ways to express the
        future. You can use <b>will</b> or <b>going to</b> depending on the
        situation.
